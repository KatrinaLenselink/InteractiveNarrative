        This is a lot for you to process so you decide to leave the creature for now and come back later. 
        </p>

        <p>
        As you leave the basement you look down the hall and see that the coast is clear. That is, until you turn to leave and run directly into your boss. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You try to run but you immediately feel a sharp sting in your neck and everything goes black. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You wake up at home surrounded by your family. You see your old boss standing there and you try to warn your family that he is dangerous and keeping an alien locked in the basement. 
        </p>

        <p>
        All this gets you is pitying looks from your family. Your old boss explains that you slowly started to go crazy while at work and now believe that aliens exist. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You don't even protest because you know that will only make things worse, but you know what you saw was real. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Your boss gives you a sly wink before walking out the door. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You will stop at nothing to prove that you are not crazy. 
        </p>

        <p>
        THE END
