        <p>You are feeling uneasy after the TV cutting out, so you decide not to answer the phone. </p>

         <p>  You talk with your family and assure them that it was likely just an electrical outage and that it's nothing serious. </p> 
            
         <p>   As they head to bed, you start to wonder what the phone call was about. You check the phone and see that it's a private number. </p>
            
           <p> What do you do? </p>
