        You continue to spend your days travelling down to the basement using the secret tunnel. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You have learned the guard's routine and know when no one will be down there. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Each time you bring a portable translater so you can communicate with the creature. You have learned that their species is called Humans and that their planet is in danger. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You also discuss what your boss wants from the human and how you can both safely escape. Each piece of new information gets written down in your notebook to be read later. 
        </p>

        <p>
        So far you haven't gotten closer to figuring out what your boss is up to, but you notice a lot of strange occurrences lately.
