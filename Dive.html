        <p>Even though you are tired, you are too excited to go to bed. You stay up all night working on decoding the message. </p>

       <p> Early in the morning another message comes into the control panel!
        
        You continue working hard and you finally figure out the code! </p> 
        
        <p>The first message reads: "We think we have finally created technology that will transmit messages to life on other planets." 
        </p>

        <p>
        The second message says: "Our first spaceship has landed on a new planet. Coordinates are 43 o 8'11" N 79 o 14'15" W" </p> 
        
         <p>You are estatic at this discovery! </p>

<p> What do you do? </p>
