        You aren't sure you're prepared to watch what your boss has in mind, so you opt to head upstairs back to your room. 

        
        <p>
        You try not to think of what is happening downstairs, but then you start to think about how things would have been different if you had made different choices along the way. 
        </p>

        <p>
        The pressure gets to be too much and you decide to head home to your family. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You leave a note for your boss on his desk, and then you make the drive back home. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Your family welcomes you back and they understand your decision. 
        </p>

        <p>
        However, when you go to bed that night, you can't help but wonder about that new species. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You decide that there was nothing else you could have done and that there was only one path you could have followed. 
        </p>

        <p>
        This knowledge leads you into a deep sleep, with no regrets. 
        </p>

        <p>
          THE END  
        </p>
