        You push the feeling aside and step closer to the cage. You can now see that it is a creature that has a large, round head that seems to be made of metals and plastic rather than flesh. 
        </p>

        <p>
        The creature startles as you get near. You try to convey the message that you come in peace, but the creature shrinks away. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You now understand why your boss is being so secretive. No one can know that they have captured a creature from another planet.
