       <p> You jump out of bed and get dressed, eager to know what is happening. 
        You follow the footsteps down to the basement where you see a crowd of soldiers gathered around a sealed enclosure. </p>
        
       <p> You can only get small glimpses of the creature inside the cage, but it is unlike anything you've seen before. 
        
        Its eyes are wild, and it is wearing this strange suit that fully covers its unnatural body. </p>
        
       <p> You gasp at the sight and the soldiers turn around. There is a slight look of panic in their eyes as they force you back upstairs, saying that this room is confidential. </p>
        
       <p> What do you do?</p>
