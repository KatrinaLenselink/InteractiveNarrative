       <p> You decide to get a couple more minutes of rest to ensure you are fully rested when working today. 
        You end up sleeping for a couple more hours and wake to find your boss standing over your bed, clearly angry. </p>
        
       <p> He yells at you for not responding to the alarms and informs you that you missed out on another message from Them. 
        
        He has decided that you are not taking this seriously and asks you to leave.</p> 
        
        
       <p> What do you do?</p>
