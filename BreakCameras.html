        You know you don't have a lot of time, but you can't risk getting caught. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You take a stick that was lying around the room (you don't want to think about why its there) and smash the security cameras. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Then you rush out of the room with the creature in tow. You make it out of the space station without being noticed and the creature leads you to its spaceship. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You say goodbye to the creature, and surprisingly it wraps its two strange arms around you. 
        </p>

        <p>
        At first you think its a form of attack, but then you realize it is thanking you. 
        </p>

        <p>
        The creature leaves in its spaceship and you head back to the space station.
