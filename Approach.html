            You move towards the movement, however your movements are too fast and it must startle Them because the next thing you know there is something crashing into your side, knocking you to the ground. 
       </p>

<p> You roll onto your back and look up into the round dome-like head of this strange creature that hit you. </p> 

<p> It seems to have a crack in its face and it lets out a continuous hissing sound that you can't understand. <p>  

<p> You are still trying to figure out what species They are when the Thing pulls a strange looking weapon from the side of their leg and points it at you. </p> 

<p> You briefly wonder why this creature only has two legs and two arms right before there is a flash of light and everything goes black. </p> 

<p> THE END </p>
