        Now that you are done yelling, you realize how thirsty you are. You accept the drink and sit down in a chair.
        </p>

        <p>
        As you sit, you feel as if you almost sink through the chair to the floor, but when you check everything seems normal. 
        </p>

        <p>
        As you sip on the slightly bitter liquid, you feel yourself calming down.
        </p>

        <p>
        By the time you finish your drink, your head is feeling airy and you can't quite remember what you came into his office for. 
        </p>

        <p>
        What do you do?
