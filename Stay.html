        You are intrigued by these new developments and you decide to stay. 
        </p>

        <p>
        As the questioning gets more and more intense, you doubt the process slightly. 
        </p>

        <p>
        But you know it is for the greater good of your planet and you force yourself to become stony and uncaring. 
        </p>

        <p>
        This continues for weeks until your boss has all the information they need. 
        </p>

        <p>
        The boss arranges for a interview with the local news, and assembles a team. 
        </p>

        <p>

        What do you do? 
        </p>
