        You rush to find your boss and get some answers on what is happening. 
      </p>

      <p>
        You find him in his office, and you slam the door behind you. You notice that there was a weird shimmer to the way the door closed, but you are too upset to care. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Your boss looks up in surprise. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You yell at your boss and say that you never agreed to be a part of a mission that kept living beings captive. You thought the purpose of finding new life was to interact with it and gain trust, not force it into captivity. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Your boss lets you finish your rant. He then gets up and pours himself a drink. He offers you a glass. 
        </p>

        <p>
        What do you do?
