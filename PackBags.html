      <p>  You look at your boss in shock. He can't seriously be firing you on your first day back! </p> 

       <p> However, you worked with him long enough to know to not question him. You pack up your bags and apologize to your boss. 
        
        You drive home and have to tell your family why you are back so soon. </p>
        
       <p> You are disappointed in yourself and upset that you'll never get to know what happens after They called. </p>
        
       <p> THE END </p>
