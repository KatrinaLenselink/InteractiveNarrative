You are shocked by the state of this new planet. You ask to hear more about what is happening. 
</p> 

<p> 
The creature explains that their species does not take care of their planet (known to them as Earth) and uses products that do not break down and destroys the natural life all around them. 
</p>

<p> 
The worst part is that the species as a whole knows about these issues and do not do enough to correct these issues. 
</p>

<p> 
You can not imagine a species willingly letting their planet die, so you want to know more about them.
