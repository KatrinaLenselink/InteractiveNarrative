        <p>
        Each night you read over all of your notes about the strangeness around the space station. 
</p>

<p>
Things have been going missing and you have noticed lots of things flickering like they are made of light rather than solid material. 
</p>

<p>
One night while you are down in the basement talking to the human, you hear the door at the top of the stairs open.
</p>

<p>
You quickly hide in the tunnel but keep the door cracked so you can hear what's happening. 
</p>

<p>
A soldier comes into view and you see him talking to the human. Nothing of interest happens so you are about to leave when you see the soldier trip on a box you left out. 
</p>

<p>
For a brief second time stops and the soldier never hits the ground. 
</p>

<p>
There is that weird flicker around him as he rights himself and then time resumes like nothing happened. 
</p>

<p>
You are in shock but you manage to close the door quietly and make it to your room without being seen.
