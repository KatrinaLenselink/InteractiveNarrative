        <p>
        You don't question your boss and stay in the control room, waiting for messages. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You continue to do this every day for a couple of weeks. 
       </p> 

       <p>
       In this time you recieve a couple of messages. They don't always make sense to you, but your boss is always very excited. 
        </p>

        <p>
        He starts to come into the control room each day smelling slightly metallic. One day there is a red liquid on the cuffs of his sleeves that he claims is jam.

        <p>
        What do you do?
