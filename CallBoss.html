       <p> You call your boss into the room to let him know what you've discovered!</p>

        <p>He assembles a small team to go investigate the strange coordinates which are not too far away from the space station. </p>
        
      <p>  When you arrive at the location, you see a spaceship that looks similar to the ones at the station but with much more primitive technology. </p>
        
      <p> Your boss calls out and a creature emerges from behind the spaceship. </p> 
        
       <p> The team immediately attacks and captures the creature in a net. You realize your boss was never interested in Them for conversation but rather for information. </p>
        
        <p>What do you do? </p>
