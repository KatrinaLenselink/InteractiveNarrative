        While your boss is visiting the creature, you take the opportunity to leave a note on his desk explaining why you need to leave. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You pack your bags and slip out the back door. Once you arrive home, you explain to your family what has happened. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You are worried that your boss will try to track you down, so you and your family decide to leave your house behind and set off to find somewhere off the grid to live. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You decide to dedicate the rest of your life to researching these creatures and finding the best way to help Them. After all, it's the least you can do.  
        </p>

        <p>
        THE END
