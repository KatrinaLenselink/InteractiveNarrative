        You go through this new door. You are hesitant but want to know where it leads. You follow the tunnel for a couple minutes and it slowly feels like you're rising. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You come to the end of the tunnel and see a slide door set into the wall.
        </p>

        <p>
        You open this door quietly and are staring at the back of a painting. You move the painting out of the way and realize you are down the hall from your room. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You are estatic about this find! You know it will help you to visit the creature in private and try to figure out a plan of escape. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You go to bed with many plans and ideas drifting through your head.
