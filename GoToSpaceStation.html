        Seething, you drive back to the space station prepared to demand answers. 
        </p>

        <p>
        However, when you arrive you are greeted by the sight of an empty field. 
        </p>

        <p>
        As you look at the ground, you notice a note. It is addressed to you. It reads: 
        </p>

        <p>
        "Sorry for the abrupt leaving but we had to answer when They called." 
        </p>

        <p>
        You are shocked and confused but there is nothing left for you here. 
        </p>
