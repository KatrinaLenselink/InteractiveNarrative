        You decide that things are getting a little too suspicious and you want to know what is going on. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You sneak down to the basement door without anyone seeing you. You tiptoe down the stairs and see a group of soldiers around an enclosed cage. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You can only get small glimpses of the creature inside the cage, but it is unlike anything you've seen before. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Its eyes are wild, and it is wearing this strange suit that fully covers its unnatural body. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You gasp at the sight and the soldiers turn around. There is a slight look of panic in their eyes as they force you back upstairs, saying that this room is confidential. 
        </p>

        <p>
        What do you do?
