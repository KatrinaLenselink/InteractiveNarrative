        You feel terrible for this creature in front of you, but you understand where your boss is coming from. 
          </p>

          <p>
        You need to know more about these creatures and they could be dangerous so you want to have the upper hand. 
            </p>
        <p> 
        You bring the creature back to the space station and lock it in an enclosure in the basement. 
        </p>

        <p> 
        Your boss asks if you want to be present for the questioning of the creature. 
        </p>

        <p>
        What do you do?
