        You decide the only way to stop them is to force them to stop. 
        </p>

        <p>
        However, you underestimate the power of the soldiers and the determination of your boss. 
        </p>

        <p>
        When you try to intervene, you end up getting knocked out by the flailing captive and are thrown to the ground. 
        </p>

        <p>
        The group of soldiers are struggling to keep their grip on the captive and in the chaos, you are not noticed on the ground. The soldiers end up trampling you and unfortunately one misplaced step breaks your neck.  
        </p>

        <p>
        At least your death was swift. The same can not be said about the captive. 
        </p>

        <p>
        THE END
