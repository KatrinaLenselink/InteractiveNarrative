       <p> You look at your boss in shock. He can't seriously be firing you on your first day! 

        You yell at him about the unfairness of it all and how you are their best worker. Without you, they will never be able to communicate with Them. </p>
        
       <p> Just as you are about to throw a punch, you feel a sharp sting in your arm and see your boss holding a syringe. At first your anger doubles, but then it slowly fades into confusion as you realize you don't know where you are. </p>
        
       <p> The old man in front of you explains that you got lost and that he will be driving you home now. </p>
