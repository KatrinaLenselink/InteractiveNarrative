        You don't think you will be able to figure out anything with your head feeling like this, so you decide to go to bed. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You end up sleeping through the night and wake up early in the morning feeling refreshed. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You walk to the control room where you see your boss. For a split second you have an overwhelming feeling of deja vu and the feeling that you are missing something. 
        </p>

        <p>
        It goes away as quickly arrived, so you think it must be a lingering dream you had while you slept. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Your boss updates you on the messages that have been recieved while you were asleep and it looks like there's nothing out of the ordinary. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Just some generic messages that show that other life exists but your team has not been able to make contact yet. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You decide to get a coffee and settle into the day's work, just like usual. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You are content with the normalcy of the day but hope that soon there will be something exciting that happens. 
        </p>

        <p>
        THE END 
        </p>
