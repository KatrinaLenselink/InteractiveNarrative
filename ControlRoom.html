        You make your way to the control room and find your boss standing in front of the computers 
        </p>

        <p>
        You ask him what the commotion was all about and he tells you that while you were asleep, a second message came through and another employee was able to roughly translate the code. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You learn that the messages include the coordinates to one of Their locations. 
        </p>

        <p>
        That's all your boss tells you, but you can sense that there's something he's not telling you. 
        </p>

        <p>
        What do you do?
