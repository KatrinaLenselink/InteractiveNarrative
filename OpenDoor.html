      <p>You open the door to find your old boss standing in front of you. You go to greet him when you realize there is a strange look on his face. Just as you are about to ask him what is wrong, he pulls a knife out from behind his back and stabs you in the chest.</p>

        <p>As you fall to the ground and take your last breaths you hear:</p>
        <p>"This wouldn't have happened if you had come when they called."</p>
        
       <p> THE END.</p>
