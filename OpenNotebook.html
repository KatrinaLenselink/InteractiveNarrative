        <p>
        You frantically open your notebook and write down everything you saw. 
</p>

<p>
        You scan back through all the pages of your notes, looking for some sort of connection. 
      </p>  

      <p>
        You flip slightly too far back and end up finding a page of notes that you wrote when you first started working at the space station. 
       </p> 

       <p>
        Except....? You notice that these are not actual words but rather formulated gibberish that appears at first glance to say something but has no actual meaning. 
       </p> 

       <p>
        Almost as if it was dummy text to make a notebook appear full in an attempt to fool someone... 
       </p> 

       <p>
        All of a sudden it clicks. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You know exactly what is happening and now you realize that you are the fool. 
        </p>

        <p>
        None of this has made sense, because none of it has been real. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You are in a simulation. 
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>CONGRATULATIONS YOU HAVE WON!</strong>
