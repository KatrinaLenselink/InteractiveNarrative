        The sight of the creature in the cage is too uncomfortable, so you walk away and head back to your room. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Over the next couple weeks you try to forget about the creature in the basement. 
        </p>

        <p>
        This is not an easy task as you can often hear moaning from below and your boss has gained a constant metallic smell - which you assume is from the creature's strange metal head. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You resign yourself to this routine and know that you accepted the consequences when you answered Their call. 
        </p>

        <p>
        THE END
