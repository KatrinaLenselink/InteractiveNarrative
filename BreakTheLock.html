        You decide to physically break the lock because you don't know who could be monitoring the main computer system. 
        </p>

        <p>
        It takes you a couple tries because you want to be able to put the lock back together when you leave. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Finally you can pry the lock open and slip in the door.
        </p>

        <p>
        You find yourself standing in front of an enclosure with something inside. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You can't help but feel like you've been here before.
