        <p>
        Once you arrive back at the station, you head to bed feeling proud of yourself
        </p>

        <p>
        Just as you are slipping off to sleep, you get the nagging feeling you forgot to do something. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You wake up to your door flying open and your old boss barging into the room. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Before you can process what is happening, you are being handcuffed and led to the basement. 
        </p>

        <p>
        As you are thrown into the cage, your boss explains that they checked the cameras once they realized the creature was missing, and they caught you red-handed. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You get the sinking feeling that you won't be leaving this cage anytime soon. The only thing that comforts you is knowing that you saved the creature from this fate. 
        </p>

        <p>
        THE END
