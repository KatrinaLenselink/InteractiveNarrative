        You don't trust your boss right now and decline the drink offer.
    </p>

    <p>
        He continues sipping on his own drink before explaining what you saw. He says that while they were out on a routine scan of the area, they came across a crashed ship. 
     </p>  
     
     <p>
        They tried to help but they were only able to save one alien - the one in the cage below. Despite saving its life, the alien was hostile and dangerous. It is in the cage for its protection and yours. 
     </p>  
     
     <p>
        You still don't entirely believe him so you ask to see the creature again. 
      </p>  

      <p>
        He complys and brings you to the locked basement door. He unlocks it and gestures for you to go first. 
      </p>  

      <p>
        When you reach the cage, you lean in closely to look at the creature. You are too entralled with it that you don't notice your boss unlocking the cage until its too late. 
      </p> 
      
      <p>
        With a shove, he throws you into the cage with the creature and then locks the cage before retreating upstairs. 
      </p>  

      <p>
        You never thought it would end up this way. An alien and a human trapped in the same cage. 
       </p> 

       <p>
        THE END
