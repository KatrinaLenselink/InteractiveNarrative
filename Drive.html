      <p> You arrive at the Space Station and are greeted by your old boss.</p>

        <p> He ushers you inside and brings you to your old room, where you leave your bags. 
            
            You follow your boss to the main control room. </p>
            
          <p>  He shows you the recording of the message sent by them. It is clear proof that there is other life out there. </p>
            
          <p>  It is now way past midnight and you are processing a lot of information.</p>
            
           <p> What do you do? </p>
