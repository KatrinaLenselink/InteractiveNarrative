        You decide not to say anything. As disgusted as you are with this decision, you don't want to risk losing your job by challenging the boss. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You decide that you will come up with a plan to save the creature without your boss knowing. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Over the weeks, you slowly form a plan. You are still weeks away from being ready to execute it, but you think you have time.
        </p>

        <p>
        However, your boss has other plans. He abruptly informs you one day that the mission is over and you can go home. 
        </p>

        <p>
        As you are packing up your things, you look out the window and see the creature being transported into your boss's spaceship. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You run outside to stop it, but you're too late. Your boss is off to a new planet, to cause who knows what kind of chaos. 
        </p>

        <p>
        THE END
