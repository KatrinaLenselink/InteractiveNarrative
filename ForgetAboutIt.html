        You don't think a small fire in a basement is note-worthy so you leave it out of your notebook. 
        </p>

        <p>
        A couple more days pass and you almost forget about the strange locked door. 
        </p>

        <p>
        That is, until you hear a strange moaning sound coming from beneath the floors one night. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Now you definitely think something is off and you make your way back to the locked door.
