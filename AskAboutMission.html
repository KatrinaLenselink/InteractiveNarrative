        <p>
        Before you leave, you ask what the results of the mission are. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Your boss says that they used the messages to learn more about the culture and lives of Them and that They had to go back to their own planet which is why the mission is over. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You are dissappointed that you were not informed sooner about the meetings with Them, but happy that the mission was a succcess. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You pack up your bags and leave the space station.
