          <p> 
        You decide to send a message to your boss to let him know what you've discovered. 
        </p>

        <p> 
        Your boss does not handle the news well and demands that you bring the human back to the space station first. 
        </p>

        <p> 
        You consider it but the human tells you that they only have a limited number of resources, and if they don't leave now, they may be stuck here forever. 
        </p>

        <p> 
        You don't want that to happen, so you ignore your boss's wishes and get on the spaceship anyways. 
        </p>

        <p> 
        You both fly off into the unknown on your first ever intergalatic adventure, and you're thinking to yourself that you are pretty glad you answered when They called. 
        
        <p>
        THE END
