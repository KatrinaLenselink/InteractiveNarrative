      <p> You arrive at home and you go inside as the old man explains to your family what has happened. 

        You're very disoriented and decide to get some sleep to clear your head. </p> 
        
       <p> As you fall asleep, you have the faintest feeling that there was something off about that old man's story. 
        
        The feeling goes away as quickly as it arrived and you fall into a deep sleep. </p>
        
      <p>  Your family tries to wake you in the morning, but unfortunately you never wake up. 
          The doctors rule it out as a natural death, with no suspicious intentions. </p>
       
       <p>If only you had listened when They called. </p>
        
      <p>  THE END </p>
