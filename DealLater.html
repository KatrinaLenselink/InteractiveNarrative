        You don't want to risk getting caught so you tell yourself that you will come back later to wipe the cameras. 
        </p>

 <p>
You rush out of the room with the creature in tow. You make it out of the space station without being noticed and the creature leads you to its spaceship. 
</p>

<p>
You say goodbye to the creature, and surprisingly it wraps its two strange arms around you. 
</p>

<p>
At first you think its a form of attack, but then you realize it is thanking you. 
</p>

<p>
The creature leaves in its spaceship and you head back to the space station.
