        You decide that it is important for you to see the creature yourself, before making judgments. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You follow your boss to the basement where the creature is being kept in an enclosed cage. 
        </p>

        <p>
        The first thing you notice about the creature is it's large round head that seems to be made out of metals and plastics rather than flesh. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You wonder if maybe your boss is right to keep this Thing locked up. On the other hand, the cage isn't very large and you don't want to see the creature being mistreated. 
        </p>

        <p>
        What do you do?
