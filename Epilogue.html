        As soon as you realized you were in a simulation, everything went black. You wake up in an unfamiliar room and you realize you are strapped to a bed and hooked up to a variety of machines. As you try to free yourself, you hear a slow clap begin from the corner of the darkened room. 
        </p>

        <p>
        "Congratulations Subject 42. You have passed with flying colors" says a disembodied voice. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You are very confused but when you try to speak, you realize there is a tube down your throat. 
        </p>

        "I'm sure you're wondering what is going on here. Let me explain. I am Professor Armstrong and as you just recently discovered, you were in a simulation. Over a month ago, we had a large unidentified flying object crash into a field near our space station. When we got there, we discovered a spaceship with 3 dead aliens and one unconscious one. The casualties were taken to our labs for testing and experimentation in order to discover exactly what you were. As for you, Subject 42, you were the survivor of this crash and we wanted to use that to our advantage. However, we had no way of knowing what kind of temperment this new species had and we wanted to be careful. So we designed this simulation machine that would trick your consciousness into believing the scenarios were actually real and then we tested a variety of different situations that relied on your choices and decisions. We were curious to see how you would react to certain scenarios and if you were more likely to help a foriegn species or control them. For example, in Test Simulation 22, you were given the choice between helping the human escape or leaving them in the cage. We are happy to say that you chose the positive option 89% of the time when given the choice. Also, you are much smarter than we gave you credit for. The simulations were supposed to run for another couple weeks before we decided what the best course of action was. But you beat us to the punch by figuring out all on your own that you were in a simulation. With that in mind, we would love for you to become an ambassador for your species and work with us on Earth to bridge the gap between our two planets.  I think we can help each other out and create a mutually beneficial alliance."

        It takes you a minute to process this. But it all makes sense when Professor Armstrong steps into your line of view. He's human. He only has two arms compared to your four and his skin is a sickly shade of peach rather than a healthy shade of green. 
        </p>

        <p>
        At first you protest at the idea of working together with the human who kept you captive. However, you have the feeling that the reason your spaceship landed here in the first place was because your planet is also in danger. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You agree to Professor Armstrong's terms and are released from the table. As you look around the lab, you realize you have a lot of work to do in upgrading their computer systems. But you are always up for a challenge.

        After all, if you've learned anything from this experience, it is that when They call...

        Answer it.
