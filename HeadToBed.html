        <p> 
        You arrive back in your room, tired but proud of yourself. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You get into bed and prepare for the chaos that is coming tomorrow. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You wake up to the sounds of the alarm blaring. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You rush out to the hall and run into your boss. 
        </p>

        <p>
        From the way he tells you what is happening, you know that he doesn't suspect that you had anything to do with the creature's dissapearance. 
        </p>

        <p>
        After a couple days of searching, your boss eventually cancels the mission and sends you home. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You are happy to be back with your family and hope that the creature made its way home as well. 
        </p>

        <p>
        THE END
