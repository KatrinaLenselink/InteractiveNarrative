        <p> 
        After all that you've learned about these humans, you are desperate to help them. But you know you can't do it on your own. 
</p>

<p> 
        You convince the human to come back to your space station to talk to your boss. 
 </p> 
 
 <p> 
        Since you are so emphatic about your plan, your boss allows you to be the team lead who is going to journey to this new planet in order to save its resources. 
  </p> 
  
  <p> 
        You never could have dreamt that this would be the outcome of answering Their call.

        THE END
